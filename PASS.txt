pass:
got the environment apiUrl done and as such a build strategy that doens't involve combining the projects, albeit you can give that a shot if you want. Easy enough to do:

npm install contacts-fe (point it to your repo
npm install does npm install on node_modules/contacts-fe, then  "ng build --prod" your contacts-fe and have express app.use(express.static('node_modules/contacts-fe')


so... where from here?

guess we start building ngx app from here on out. Need testing on contacts-be, but leave that till the end I figure.
