 * Store
 * @desc - inspired by redux, a global state components can subscribe to for changes and update. Instead of actions, reducers,
 * and epics (yuck), just a global service all share with update functions and publish() to notify of changes:
 * in component:
 * constructor(store Store) { store.subscribe(state => this.someval = state.someval); }
 * to update, add an update function to Store and call it, then call publish() to publish to subscribers
 * THIS MUST BE A SINGLETON TO BE GLOBAL. It's possible you could have: Store, ContactsStore reusing the Store class with
 * different providers.
